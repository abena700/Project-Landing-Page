# Project-Landing-Page
Foundations Project Landing Page

Today is 28th February 2022 â€“ last commit and completed this project! I started 
this project on 23rd February 2022. I have learned so much about how to 
use HTML, CSS, and flexbox in particular, to make pages look 
great and be responsive. I am glad with the end results of 
this made up company landing page! I look forward to moving
into JavaScript next and adding that functionality to new 
projects when the time comes.
